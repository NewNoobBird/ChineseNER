### Final Year projects on Chinese NER and the paper is attached on https://newnoobbird.github.io/index.html Paper2. ###
This code shows the process to deal with data.


> [newsdata means BaiduData crawled from baidu]
> [testdata means data used for training]

- **BaiduData**: The Data Source.
		- Run readcsv.py to deal with data.
- **Boson**: Boson NLP API.
		- Run boson.py to get NER.
- **LTP**: LTP API.
		- Run ltp.py to get NER. You need download model from LTP website.
- **NER_CRF**:NER with CRF.
		- Run main.py to get NER.
- **NER_NN**: NER with Neural Network.
		- Run train_bilstm_crf.py to train data with BiLSTM
		- Run train_bilstm_crf_add_word.py to traiin data with CNN-LSTM
- **Estimate**: How to judge Different estimation.
		- Run eval.py to get estimation.
